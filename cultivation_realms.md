# Mortal Realm
## Body Tempering
### 9 levels
A cultivator must train their body to open their meridians. After reaching the Tempered Body 4th Stage, one begins to sense Spiritual Energy in the atmosphere. At the 7th Stage, one starts to naturally gather World Energy and absorb it into their body through their meridians, allowing them to start forming a dantian.
## Qi Gathering
### 9 levels
After the dantian is formed, a cultivator can absorbing the Qi and store it in the dantian. The cultivator can move the Qi in their dantian through their meridians allowing the Qi to nourish their body in order to effectively improve one's physique into a body capable of utilising Qi.
## Foundation Establishment
### 9 levels
After the Qi is fully absorbed into the dantian. The qi is compressed and turned into a liquid form called True Qi in the dantian creating a spiritual sea contained within. This spiritual sea will be the foundation of your future strength, so make sure to convert as much qi into True Qi as you can before you break through to the next realm. True Qi can be used to control a spiritual weapon around their body to be able to fly.
## Core Formation
### 9 levels
After a cultivator's spiritual sea is completely formed, the pressure of the True Qi makes the dantian start to crack. True Qi starts to seep through the cracks and solidify on the exterior of the dantian creating a core until the dantian is destroyed.
## Golden Core
### 9 levels
After a cultivator's core is completely formed the cultivator goes through a lightning tribulation, if the cultivator survives the heavenly lightning tempers the core to be able to handle any pressure from the inside. The cultivator is able to pear into their core, the True Qi stored in the core appears gold as it has been purified by the heavenly lightning. True Qi can then be used to freely control the cultivators spiritual weapon without being near the cultivators body, this technique is called `Void Control`.

The cultivator has to condense their True Qi into a solidified form, this form floats above the spiritual sea and forms a nascent.
## Nascent Soul
### 9 levels
Once the nascent is completely solidified within the core, the cultivator must go through another more destructive lightning tribulation. If the cultivator survives, the heavenly lightning merges the culitvators soul with the nascent, forging a nascent soul. The nascent soul opens up the cultivator's knowledge sea is within the mind. A Knowledge Sea gives one the ability to store all of their knowledge, memories, techniques, and Soul Artifacts. The nascent soul has the ability to automatically absorb and condense Qi from the surroundings into True Qi to continuously replenish the spiritual sea. At this stage the cultivator almost has a form of unlimited True Qi as long as there is enough Qi in their surroundings.

The nascent soul helps the cultivator to control the almost endless True Qi, this increases their understanding and control over True Qi enabling the cultivator to condense True Qi below their feet to make platforms for them to walk on, appearing as if they are walking or running through the air, this technique is called `Void Steps`. With the increased control over True Qi, the cultivator can also spread True Qi out from the mind performing a technique called `Divine Sense`. Divine Sense allows one to see and/or sense everything within a certain radius of their surroundings as long as it is sufficiently powerful.

The more True Qi the nascent soul absorbs, the more powerful the nascent soul becomes. Able to absorb more qi more quickly, effectively meaning the cultivator can utilise more True Qi. In the Mortal Realm, you are practically invincible at this stage as continuing past this stage takes an incredible amount of time and True Qi to break through.
## Half-Step Saint
When you reach the 9th level of Nascent Soul, the cultivator will start to not be able to store all the True Qi gathered from the nascent soul and start to expend the excess. To progress further in your cultivation, you must compress your True Qi even further to take up less space, so you can store more. In the process of condensing, you purify the impurities out of the True Qi to get expelled through the body leaving behind a small amount a very pure essence called Divine Qi also known by some as Divine Essence. Divine Qi is the pinnacle and purest form of Qi in the mortal world, in some instances it can be generated in nature to help with hastening the process of gathering Divine Qi.

Divine Qi is so pure and condensed that it can subtly interact with the Heavenly Dao, allowing the cultivator to fly freely and expending a considerably less amount of Qi than Void Steps. The faster the cultivator flies the more Divine Qi is used, this is at an exponential rate.

This is the start of becoming a divine being. 
## Saint
### 3 orders
Once the cultivator's golden core is full of Divine Qi, the cultivator will go through another thunder tribulation. This tribulation is the Heavenly Dao testing the cultivator to see if they are worthy and/or capable of being a divine being.

If the cultivator survives this region destroying calamity, the Heavenly Dao rewards the cultivator by helping them go beyond mortal limits. The heavenly lightning tempers the Nascent Soul with Divine Qi becoming a Divine Soul. A Divine Soul can utilise divine sense freely without the need of expending Qi, being divine also means it allows a cultivator to see and/or sense everything in the world. The Divine Soul can also be used to attack other cultivator's souls, dealing critical damage that can not naturally be healed. Anyone that hasn't opened their Knowledge Sea will instantly die as their soul is destroyed.

The heavenly lightning also reconstructs the cultivators body destroying any impurities and returning the cultivator to a youthful appearance and making the cultivators body become a Divine Body, unable to be damaged or pierced by anything in the mortal realm, this is called `Divine Body Reconstruction`. In the process of Divine Body Reconstruction, a cultivator will loose all of their Divine Qi as the body is getting destroyed and reconstructed over and over again. A benefit of Divine Body Reconstruction is the cultivators Golden Core gets reforged into a Divine Core, able to hold an unlimited amount of Divine Qi. During Divine Body Reconstruction a cultivator is at their weakest and any external factor could make the Divine Body Reconstruction fail and the cultivator may lose all their cultivation or worse die.
## Return To Origin
### 3 levels
At the peak of the Third Order Saint realm, a cultivator can start to merge their being with nature.

The first stage of this realm is to merge their Divine Qi with nature, becoming imperceptible to anyone weaker than the cultivator.

The second stage of this ream is to merge the Divine Soul with nature, becoming omnipresent, able to perceive anything and everything under the Heavenly Dao and between Heaven and Earth. A cultivator merging their Divine Soul with nature also allows the cultivator to instantly kill any cultivator below the Return To Origin realm, their body will crumble, disintegrate and collapse inwards until there is nothing left as they no longer have a divine soul to support their body structure.

The third stage of this realm is to merge their mind with nature. Having their mind be one with nature means to clear the mind of any distractions, worries or regrets. It also allows the cultivator to be impervious to any soul attacks making them virtually immortal in the mortal realm.
# Immortality
To achieve immortality is to achieve the final stage of the return to origin realm, once a cultivator is at this stage, they can choose to ascend to immortality. When once ascends to immortality, the cultivator goes through another lightning tribulation, except this tribulation is an Immortal Tribulation. An Immortal Tribulation does not harm the cultivator nor their surroundings, in the history books of famous powerful sects, they report the Immortal Tribulation being like a wave of pure pleasure and delight as all of the cultivators Divine Qi is converted into a supreme power called Immortal Qi. The Divine Core is also transformed into an Immortal Core to hold the supreme power of the Immortal Qi. The cultivator will go through this tribulation for 3-5 days depending on the amount of Divine Qi stored in their Divine Core, the longer the tribulation, the more powerful of an immortal you can become.

Once the cultivator has gone through the Immortal Tribulation, the Heavenly Dao directly speaks into the cultivators mind allowing the cultivator to have 3 days to sort out their mortal affairs before they ascend to the Immortal Realm. Once the 3 days are up the Heavenly Dao will open up a path to the Immortal Realm called the Immortal Ladder. As this path leads to the Immortal Realm, Immortal Qi leaks from the Immortal Realm, blessing the surroundings of where the cultivator ascended transforming treasures, plants and pills to become Immortal treasures, Immortal plants and Immortal pills, they also develop consciousness.

# Immortal Realm (WIP)
Once a cultivator reaches the Immortal Realm, the Immortal Dao welcomes them by helping them transform their Divine Body into an Immortal Body and the Divine Soul is transformed into an Immortal Soul under the pressure of the dense amount of Immortal Qi. The Immortal Body allows the cultivator to have an infinite lifespan, the Immortal Soul allows the cultivator to directly absorb Immortal Qi without the need of a tribulation to help like in the mortal realm.
## Loose Immortal
### 5 levels - Early, Middle, Late, Perfect, Supreme
This is the realm a cultivator becomes when they ascend to the immortal realm. This realm is all about gaining more Immortal Qi, each stage allowing the Immortal Core to expand and store more Immortal Qi than before. The more Immortal Qi the cultivator acquired from the Immortal Tribulation, the higher the stage the cultivator will start at. The Late Stage is the limit a cultivator can reach by ascending.
## Land Immortal
### 5 levels - Early, Middle, Late, Perfect, Supreme
The cultivator realises they can manipulate the Immortal Qi to create stuff in their Immortal Core. The cultivator creates an immortal ascension platform which serve as the foundation for immortal cultivation. One can add `Divine Character Runes` into the platform to enhance their power. The Divine Soul comes into contact with this immortal ascension platform, allowing it to generate Immortal Qi without the need of absorbing from the outside world. The Divine Soul can only generate a minuscule amount of Immortal Qi at this realm.

Each time a cultivator adds enough Divine Character Runes, they will break through to the next stage. A beam of pure essence from the platform shoots into the boundary of the Immortal Core, modifying the Core with `Worldy Rules`.

When the cultivator reaches the Supreme Stage of Land Immortal, there Immortal Core is transformed using the Divine Character Runes to become an `Internal World`.
## Earth Realm
The cultivator create land under the immortal ascension platform, allowing for plants to be created on the land. The more Immortal Qi the cultivator has the more land will be expanded. The Internal World will expand alongside the land's expansion. At this stage, the cultivator can set foot inside their Internal World, where they have control over everything that happens within, including the `Rules Of The World`. At this realm the cultivator can descend back to the mortal realm temporarily as the cultivator has developed their own world to rely on rather than the Dao (Heavenly or Immortal), where their power will be limited.
## Sea Boundary
The cultivator would have to create sea around the earth expansion, allowing for simple sea creatures to be created in the sea. Just like the Earth Realm, the more Immortal Qi the cultivator has the more land will be expanded. The Internal World will expand alongside the land's expansion.
## Six Paths of Reincarnation
### 6 levels
Have Immortal Corona. Must Condense their incarnate powers in the internal storage. Only after they condense their incarnation power six times will they be able to reach the Supreme Incarnation Stage. Once the cultivator reaches this realm, the cultivator is able to be reborn within their Inner World.
## Heaven Boundary
Lighting up the stars in the internal storage. Once the cultivator reaches this stage, they have an infinite amount rebirths through their Inner World's incarnations.
## Imperial Sky Realm
Refining the Immortal soul to the top of the sky
## Guixu Realm
The cultivator makes an area that looks like an endless void under the incarnations.
## Void River Stage
At this stage, the cultivator will create a river of energy in their internal storage, traversing the world, it will start from heaven and be stopped by guixu then go back and gather at the heaven and become the source of the river, connecting the heaven and earth of the body.

As the river grows the cultivator will compress the world in their bodies into pure energy crystals when their physique is strong enough.

Creating the first energy crystal,

then the second, and third, repeating the process creating them infinitely,

forming groups of worlds in the internal body of the cultivator,

turning the river of energy into a replica of the void river.

At this stage, one will have infinite energy.
