## Body Tempering
9 levels\
After reaching the Tempered Body 4th Stage, one begins to sense World Energy in the atmosphere. At the 7th Stage, one starts to naturally gather World Energy and absorb it into their body, allowing them to start storing Yuan Qi.
## Initial Foundation
9 levels\
Cultivators at this realm have accumulated enough Yuan Qi to start using it in techniques. Though Yuan Qi can be used to affect the body and the environment, it can't yet leave the body.
## Qi Refinement
9 levels\
At this realm, cultivators can finally release Yuan Qi outside of their body in order to be used for attacking, defending, and etc. This is also the first realm in which a cultivator experiences a World Baptism, which tempers their body for the next realm.
## Half-step True Foundation
1 level\
At this realm one purifies their Yuan QI into a significantly more powerful True Qi by condensing their Yuan Qi.
## True Foundation
9 levels\
To reach this realm, one needs to purify all their Yuan Qi into the significantly more powerful True Qi, which can perform far more complex tasks than Yuan Qi. Thanks to True Qi, cultivators can start flying at this realm.
## Nascent Soul
9 levels\
At this realm, a cultivator develops a Knowledge Sea and Divine Sense. A Knowledge Sea gives one the ability to store all of their knowledge, memories, techniques, and Divine Soul Artifacts. A Divine Sense allows one to see and/or sense everything within a certain radius of their surroundings as long as it is sufficiently powerful. A Divine Sense can also be used to attack another cultivator’s Divine Soul.
## Transcendent
3 levels\
With sufficient comprehension of the Heavenly Way, one can eventually reach this realm.
## Half-step Saint
1 level\
At this realm, a cultivator has to purify their True Qi into Saint Qi by condensing their True Qi.
## Saint
3 levels\
To reach this realm, one needs to purify all their True Qi into Saint Qi in order to reach the Saint Realm. At the 3rd Order Saint Realm, the average cultivator‘s flesh body is strong enough to withstand the environment of the Starry Sky.
## Saint King
3 levels\
One only needs a stable foundation, Saint Qi accumulation, and sufficient comprehension of the Heavenly Way in order to reach this realm.
## Origin Returning
3 levels\
At this realm, with some training, a cultivator should be able to merge their Will, Saint Qi, and Divine Soul Strength into Shi, which suppresses enemy cultivators. Developing one's Shi is the most important aspect of the Origin Returning Realm, and is the main distinguishing factor between these cultivators.

In addition, a cultivator can learn Yuan Control Mastery at this realm if their Divine Sense becomes strong enough, greatly increasing their combat efficacy.
## Origin King
3 levels\
When one develops their Shi to the Grand Accomplishment stage, they can attempt to cultivate to this realm. Upon success, their Shi evolves into the incredibly more powerful Domain. Unlike Shi, Domain can affect the physical environment around an Origin King, making them essentially the master of the space it envelops. Likewise, these cultivators are exponentially more powerful than Origin Returning Realm cultivators.
## Dao Source
3 levels\
To breakthrough to this realm, one must develop their Domain to the Grand Accomplishment stage to start comprehending Principle Strength. They must also completely convert their Saint Qi into Source Qi. Source Qi is a qualitative upgrade over Saint Qi, and is the foundation that allows Dao Source Realm cultivators to utilize the strength of World Principles.

Therefore, one must also have access to a world with sufficient World Principles to allow for the conversion of their Saint Qi to naturally take place, such as in the Ancestral Domain or Star Boundary.

As stated above, cultivators at this realm start to draw support from the strength of one or more types of World Principles (ex. Space Principles). From here on out, a cultivator's comprehension and capability toward the manipulation of Principles greatly distinguishes them from other martial artists of the same realm.
